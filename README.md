# AI-Powered Image Segmentation with MaskFormer

## Overview
This project fine-tunes the MaskFormer model using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch for instance and semantic segmentation on a custom dataset. It includes training, inference, and real-world evaluation.

## Features
- MaskFormer fine-tuning with Hugging Face Transformers
- Semantic & instance segmentation
- PyTorch-based training pipeline
- Inference on real-world images
- Optimized for GPU acceleration

## Setup
To install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python src/train.py

python src/inference.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg

### ✅ Step 3: Save the File

Now save the file with **this exact name**:

- **File name:** `README.md`
- **Save in:** Your main project folder (`AI-Image-Segmentation-MaskFormer`)

> Make sure:
> - The file extension is `.md`, **not** `.txt`
> - You don’t accidentally save it inside a subfolder like `src/`

---

📣 Once you’ve saved the file, just reply with **“README.md saved”** — and we’ll move on to the next file: `.gitignore`, slowly and step by step like this.
